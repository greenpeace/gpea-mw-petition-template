# GPEA MW Petition template

The MW petition template is built on React.js and Chakraui library.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## MW Petition Design Migration Schema

During the build, the project will pull the basic campaign data from the schema endpoint based on the `MARKET` and `PROJECT_NAME` in the `env`.

## Quick start

1. Run `npm run install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the localhost.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Steps to follow: Cloning a petition page

```text
src/
└── apps/
    ├── hk/
    │   ├── project1/
    │   └── project2/
    └── tw/
        ├── project1/
        └── project2/
```

1. Go to `apps` folder and you will see the project folder groupped by NRO.
2. Duplicate the entire project folder (e.g `/apps/hk/arctic`) and rename it to a new project name.
3. Modify the Banner / Thankyou content, the content will be used on the Hero landing section (first screen area).
4. Modify the `Content.js` and `Thankyou.js`, the content will be used on the signup form and thankyou form.
5. Modify the `SEO.js`, the content will become the page meta data (sharing content and image etc).
6. Modify the local `.env.development` and `.env.production` files, the content is used to configure the development / build evironment.
7. Try to run the `npm run dev` script to check if the app can be boosted successfully.

## To deploy the page onto the ftp server

1. Run `yarn build:full or yarn build:production` to check if the react app can be built normally. (Optional if you have done it before)
2. Run `ayrn export:full or yarn export:production` in order to build the app and export the static files.
3. Now you should be able to find the output static files in the `out` folder.
4. (Optional but preferred deploy option) Assuming you have configured the prerequisite of the ftp credientials. You can run `yarn deploy:full or yarn deploy:production` to deploy the output to the destinated ftp server programmatically.

## Pretty-quick

We use Prettier with [pretty-quick](https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick) as the pre-commit tool. This can re-format your files that are marked as “staged” via git add before you commit.

[Installation guide](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)

```node
npx husky-init
npm install --save-dev pretty-quick
npx husky set .husky/pre-commit "npx pretty-quick --staged"
```

## How to utilize the .env files

.env file will store the environment variable for the build script and deployment script. The project will fetch the project theme data from the [project schema spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_NziZSM1zHoQOzo_BgPS2apl7TLCqRRbO0ev1ykkl08/edit#gid=0).
There is the priority of the .env files when it comes to different environment. The script will run the app based on the env mode to get the variables.

- `.env`: The default env file. We keep the value empty so it can be shared across the users and will not cause conflicts
- `.env.development`: The env file designed for development mode. You only need to modify the project local path and project name in the file.
- `.env.production`: The env file for production mode. You will need to provide all project configs PLUS the path configs and FTP configs in the file.

## How to maintain the styles

Chakraui is heavily rely on style props to manage and override the component styles. Please check the available props in the doc.
